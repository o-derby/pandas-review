# pandas-review
Review game for the pandas library. Review table manipulation, probability, visualization, and regression analysis.

This is my first time using streamlit so I figured what better way to learn how to use it than creating a review game for table manipulation and analysis. Also a great way for me to review for my midterm and hopefully help others out too!
